This is part of The GIFt, the animated GIF picture frame allowing offline use for a Raspberry Pi.
The HTML was authored by Ryan Sumner, and he has graciously allowed me to post it.
If part of the main project, please download the entire GIF folder, as the path for the RasPi requires the entire folder to be on the desktop.
